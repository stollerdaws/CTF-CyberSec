So here we have  amore complicated Format String problem, but with increased
complexity comes increased versatility. There are a dozen ways to make writes
to end up getting the flag. The hint here is telling us that there are strings in memory
which are writable, so if we can find the address to these strings, we can overwrite
them with whatever we want. Also since ASLR is turned off, we can find the addresses of 
instructions and jump to them as well. I chose to overwrite the logs file with flag,
which is not exactly optional its by far the easiest way to get the flag to open
then I overwrite the address of exit with the address of search so I can get that 
function to run again.], this time searching the flag.
Then I overwrite the address of strstr the substring function to jump
down two lines so that no matter what it prints out the value of the first line in the file
which happens to be our flag.
