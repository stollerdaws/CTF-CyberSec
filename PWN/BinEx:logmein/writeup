This is a basic format string problem where we have a pointer that we
can overwrite to some nonzero value such that the program calls getflag.
We can figure out our offset to our format parameter by sending in %1$08x and so on until we reach the one that prints the characters 
at the beginning of our payload. Once we have that we can put the address
of the pointer given to us in that spot so that when we perform our write, it writes over that pointer with 00000 and thats the whole ticket
