This is a simple buffer overflow challenge. The program creates a 
50 byte buffer, but then calls fgets with 0x50 as the argument which is 80
So we need to find the offset of the flag variable. To do this we 
can open gdb and type the following commands:
b *main + 32    #This is where flag is set to 0xaabdcdee
after this instruction we can step so the value will be updated,
the next instruction will begin to fill the buffer with 0
take note of the addresses that make up the destination of the mov instructions
this is where our buffer will be allocated, the flag is at rbp - 4
and the buffer starts at rbp - 64
so our payload needs to be at an offset of 60 from the start of the buffer
you could also just send a huge input of EEEE since thats what the flag is checking for, but that is not very elegant.
