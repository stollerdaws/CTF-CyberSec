This is another buffer overflow where we have to overwrite a variable
to pass a check that would call exit, then overwrite the return address to jump to win instad of main

So, at 64 (the edge of the buffer), we overwrite the variable to 0xdeadbeef
and at 80, we overwrite the return address to the address of win

Check the binary in ghidra to see the decompiled source and use GDB
or PWNtools to get the address of win
