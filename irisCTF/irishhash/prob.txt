Note:

 

Hi everyone, here are hints for the last osint challenge with the password hash.

 

Focus on Iris and what she finds important!
There are three words (not letters, but words), and a certain amount of numbers following it
There's no leet words, proper capitalization nothing like (ExAmPLE), no special characters as well like -,! etc.

 

If you find a specific date, do not include the month'a name into your word list. Just use the numbers!!
